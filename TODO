1.  Hide slices that are too small and cause the annoying whitness
    Basically add the ability to have only whole numbers and discard everything smaller
2.  Come up with the naming of chef-*.json if possible (can chef output diff stuff for us?)
3.  Add new files to available to display in the select box
4.  Look at possibly having fancy line charts to track the deploy times of various sized instances
    just write to a simple JSON file and keep updating it on every run if doable. can be regenerated on
    full on runs based on the available chef files.
5.  Graph out times per component, per instance size of some sort
6.  Default JSON files
7.  Add the ability to toggle instance / env info.
8.  Add provider and instance size as dropdown if there is more than one
9.  If there is only one option of something then skip the select choice, make it hidden.
